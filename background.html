    <h3>Who is my family?</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>My Mother</dt>
        <dd>My mother is very nice and hard working. I call her Mom most of the time. She is a librarian at a elementary school and is really good with kids. She helps me do a lot of things and is smart.</dd>
        <dt>My Father</dt>
        <dd>My father is very nice as well and is tall like me. I call him Dad most of the time. He has a good sense of humor and laughs at me all of the time. We also share a birthday.</dd>
        <dt>My Little Sister</dt>
        <dd>My little sister is 12 years old and is in 7th grade. She is smart and can be very nice, but can also be very mean to me if she wants to be. She used to be bad at making jokes about me but now she roasts me with
            regularity.</dd>

    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <div class="background">
        <p>I was born at Marin General Hospital on October 7th, 2003. I spent all of my time with my family until I went to kindergarten at Coleman Elementary School when I was 4 years old. Right before I went to kindergarten,
            my little sister was born. Every summer and winter since I was born, we have visited my mom and dad's family on the East Coast. We still do this to this druring the summer and winter breaks.</p>

    <div class="facts_about_me">
        <p>I think that, in general, I am very happy and energetic. I try to be optimistic. I am also independant, very sociable and kind.I am also very competitive, and I think I am funny.</p>
        <p>Some interesting facts about me are that I am 6'2", I have a big toe named Toeby, and I love ice cream. Other foods that I love are burritos, sushi, pizza, grilled cheese, grilled food, brownies, thai food, fruit, cereal, ginger beer, and tomatoes. In general, I love all food. I am always trying to improve in everything that I do because I like to be better at things.
        </p>
        <p>I have a couple of goals for this academic school year. I would like to stay on top of all of my classes, take the SAT (and hopefully get a good score), get my driving permit, improve at sports, and not fail my AP classes.
